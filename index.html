     History of the Mark 1 Mr2
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Toyota introduced the first-generation MR2 in 1984, designating it the model code "W10". When fitted with the 1.5-liter 3A engine, it was known as the <strong>"AW10"</strong>. Likewise, the 1.6-liter 4A version is identified by the <strong>"AW11"</strong> code.</li>
      <li>In Japan, the MR2 was marketed exclusively via Toyota's Toyota Auto Store and Toyota Vista Store, both rebranded in 1998 as Netz Toyota Store. At its introduction in 1984, the MR2 won the <strong>Car of the Year Japan</strong>.</li>
      <li>The MR2's suspension and handling were designed by Toyota with the help of <strong>Lotus engineer Roger Becker</strong>. Toyota's cooperation with Lotus during the prototype phase can be seen in the AW11, and it owes much to Lotus's sports cars of the 1960s and 1970s.</li>
      <li>Toyota employed the naturally aspirated <strong>4A-GE</strong> 1,587 cc (1.6 L; 96.8 cu in) inline-four engine, a DOHC four-valve-per-cylinder motor, borrowed from the E80 series <strong>Corolla</strong>. This engine was also equipped with Denso electronic port fuel injection and <strong>T-VIS</strong> variable intake geometry, giving the engine a maximum power output of 112 hp (84 kW) in the US, 128 hp (95 kW) in the UK, 116 or 124 PS (85 or 91 kW; 114 or 122 hp) in Europe, 118 hp (88 kW) in Australia and 130 PS (96 kW; 128 hp) in Japan. Japanese models were later detuned to 120 PS (88 kW; 118 hp). A five-speed manual transmission was standard, with a four-speed automatic available as an option.</li>
      <li>Road tests delivered 0–60 mph (97 km/h) times in the mid- to high-8 second range and 1⁄4 mile (402 m) times in the mid- to high-16 second range, significantly faster than the four-cylinder <strong>Pontiac Fiero</strong> or <strong>Fiat X1/9</strong>. In the home market, the AW10 base model was offered, which used the more economical 1,452 cc (1.5 L; 88.6 cu in) 3A-U engine rated at 61 kW (82 hp).</li>
      <li>In 1986 (1988 for the US market), Toyota introduced a <strong>supercharged</strong> engine for the MR2. Based on the same block and head, the <strong>4A-GZE</strong> was equipped with a small Roots-type supercharger and a Denso intercooler. T-VIS was eliminated and the compression ratio was lowered to 8:1. It produced 145 hp (147 PS; 108 kW) at 6,400 rpm and 186 N⋅m; 137 lb⋅ft (19 kg⋅m) of torque at 4,400 rpm and accelerated the car from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 6.5 to 7.0 seconds. The supercharger was belt-driven but actuated by an electromagnetic clutch, so that it would not be driven except when needed, increasing fuel economy. Curb weight increased to as much as 2,494 lb (1,131 kg) for supercharged models, due to the weight of the supercharger equipment and a new, stronger transmission. A fuel selector switch was also added in some markets, to allow the car to run on regular unleaded fuel if required. In addition to the new engine, the MR2 SC was also equipped with stiffer springs, and received special <strong>"tear-drop"</strong> aluminium wheels. The engine cover had two raised vents (only one of which was functional) that visually distinguished it from the naturally aspirated models. It was also labeled <strong>"SUPER CHARGER"</strong> on the rear trunk and body mouldings behind both doors. This model was never offered outside of the Japanese and North American markets, although some cars were privately imported to other countries.</li>
      <li>American car magazines <strong>Road & Track</strong> and <strong>Car and Driver</strong> both chose the MR2 on their <strong>"ten best"</strong> car lists. <strong>The Australian Wheels magazine</strong> chose the 1988 MR2 as its favourite sports car. The MR2 was <strong>Motor Trend's</strong> Import Car of the Year for 1985. The MR2 was also on <strong>Car and Driver</strong> magazine's Ten Best list for 1986 and 1987. In 2004, <strong>Sports Car International</strong> ranked the MR2 number eight on the list of Top Sports Cars of the 1980s.In 1988 and 1989 Toyota produced two final production runs of fully optioned <strong>"Super Edition"</strong> MR2s, based upon the supercharged Japanese market model, and only sold in Japan. The 1988 <strong>"Super Edition"</strong> was a run of 300 units, had white/gold two-tone paint, bronze glass, unique half-leather and half-cloth seats, along with a <strong>MOMO-commissioned</strong> steering wheel and gear knob. The 1989 model, a run of 270 units, featured a special Midnight Blue paint, the MOMO-commissioned steering wheel and gear knob, <strong>Recaro "Milano"</strong> seats with matching door panels. The 1989 model also benefited from some of the last <strong>G-Limited</strong> model options, such as the LED rear spoiler brake light and more aerodynamic wing mirrors. Both <strong>"Super Edition"</strong> models had unique decals on the rear visor and side stripes.</li>
